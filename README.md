# 🏠 RoomieHub  
*A smarter way to live together*  

---

## What and Why?  
**RoomieHub** is a mobile web application designed to make shared living smoother, fairer, and less stressful.  

Living with roommates is fun, but it often comes with challenges:  
- Whose turn is it to take out the trash?  
- Who owes money for utilities and groceries?  
- Who finished the milk without buying more?  
- Why is it so loud when someone is trying to sleep?  

These everyday conflicts create frustration and tension. RoomieHub solves this problem by offering a **centralized hub** where roommates can coordinate chores, split expenses, track shared items, and even check in on group well-being.  

By removing ambiguity and improving transparency, RoomieHub helps roommates **communicate better, reduce conflicts, and build a healthier living environment.**

## For Whom?  
The primary end-users are:  
- 🏫 **College students** living in dorms or shared apartments.  
- 🌍 **International or study-abroad students** adjusting to co-living in new environments.  
- 💼 **Young professionals** sharing apartments in cities to save on rent.  

These are real groups who face common challenges in shared housing, and RoomieHub directly addresses their needs.

## How?  
From an end-user perspective, RoomieHub will allow roommates to:  

1. **Create an account** and join or form a roommate group.  
2. **Chore Scheduler** – assign and rotate tasks with completion checkboxes and reminders.  
3. **Expense Splitter** – log shared expenses, auto-calculate balances, and visualize who owes whom.  
4. **Inventory Tracker** – manage common household items (milk, detergent, toilet paper) with low-stock/expiration alerts.  
5. **Mood Radar** – anonymously share daily emoji check-ins to gauge group atmosphere.  
6. **Noise Tracker** – submit anonymous noise complaints and view aggregated weekly reports.  

Optional stretch features may include:

## Scope  
RoomieHub is **ambitious enough to be interesting**, but **achievable within a semester** for a team of 4–6 programmers:  

- It covers multiple core concepts of modern web development:  
  - User accounts and authentication  
  - CRUD operations with a database  
  - Group-based collaboration features  
  - User-friendly mobile web UI  
- The scope ensures we can deliver a **working product** while also leaving room for **optional stretch goals** like gamification and notifications.  
- The app balances technical depth (databases, authentication, front-end design) with real-world usefulness and relevance to student life.
